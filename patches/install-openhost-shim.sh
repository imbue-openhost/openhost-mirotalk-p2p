#!/bin/sh
# Installs the OpenHost auth shim into MiroTalk's server.js at image
# build time.
#
# Two patches:
#
#   1. Copy our openhost-shim.js module next to the server so
#      `require('./openhost-shim')` resolves from server.js.
#
#   2. Insert `require('./openhost-shim')({app, hostCfg, authHost,
#      log, getIP, htmlInjector, views, OIDC})` right before the
#      `/profile` route registration -- that's after the OIDC
#      middleware is fully set up but before any user-visible
#      route handlers, so our pre-empt routes (`/`, `/newcall`,
#      `/logged`) win against the stock ones.
#
# The patch is idempotent: re-running it doesn't double-inject.
