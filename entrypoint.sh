# OpenHost entrypoint for MiroTalk P2P.
#
# Runs once at container start, before exec-ing node. Responsibilities:
#
#   1. Ensure the persistent secrets directory exists and contains
#      strong, stable values for JWT_KEY, API_KEY_SECRET, and
#      SESSION_SECRET. MiroTalk prints loud warnings at boot if
#      these are left at their insecure defaults from .env.template,
#      and the REST API refuses to operate without a real
#      API_KEY_SECRET. We auto-generate 32-byte hex secrets on first
#      boot and persist them to $OPENHOST_APP_DATA_DIR/secrets/ so
#      existing JWTs stay valid across container restarts.
#
#   2. Ensure HOST_USERS contains a usable admin credential. If the
#      operator hasn't supplied one via env, we generate a random
#      password for 'admin' on first boot and log it to stdout so
#      the operator can copy it out of `oh app logs`. Subsequent
#      boots re-read the persisted password.
#
#   3. exec the real CMD (node app/src/server.js by default).
