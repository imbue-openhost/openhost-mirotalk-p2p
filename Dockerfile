# MiroTalk P2P — self-hosted peer-to-peer WebRTC video conferencing.
#
# Architecture: a tiny Node.js signaling server (Express + socket.io).
# Browsers use the signaling to negotiate SDP + ICE, then open
# RTCPeerConnections directly to each other. The server never touches
# media. That's why there's only one TCP port published and no media
# UDP port range needed.
#
# We build from the upstream git repo pinned to a specific commit
# rather than using the published `mirotalk/p2p:latest` image. Two
# reasons: (a) reproducibility and (b) the upstream image ships with
# a committed self-signed TLS cert that httpolyglot reads at boot --
# we include that same cert in our image via the git clone.

# Pin upstream to a known-good commit (2026-04-22). Bump as needed.
