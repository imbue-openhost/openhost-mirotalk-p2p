# openhost-mirotalk-p2p

[MiroTalk P2P](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk) packaged
as an OpenHost app.

Peer-to-peer WebRTC video conferencing. The server handles signaling
only (socket.io over WebSocket on a single HTTP port); browsers
establish direct `RTCPeerConnection`s to each other and media flows
browser-to-browser without ever touching the server.

## What you get

- `https://<app>.<your-openhost-host>/` — pick or generate a room
  name, share the URL, talk.
- Built-in chat, screen sharing, client-side recording, emoji
  reactions, raise-hand, participant list, lobby.
- No server-side recording, no SFU, no media relay. The server is
  just a rendezvous point.

## Architecture

```
   browser A ◀──── signaling ────▶  MiroTalk server ◀──── signaling ────▶ browser B
       │    (socket.io over WSS, :443 via OpenHost, :3000 in-container)   │
       │                                                                   │
       └────────── WebRTC media (UDP, direct) ─────────────────────────────┘
```

The container is a small Node.js process (Express + socket.io). No
media ports. No SFU. No persistent database. Total image size ~150MB.

## Ports

| Port     | Purpose                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 3000/tcp | HTTP (and socket.io WebSocket upgrade on the same port) |

No extra ports. WebRTC media goes directly between browsers over
whatever UDP ports ICE ends up negotiating — that doesn't involve
this server at all.

## First-boot secrets

On first boot, `entrypoint.sh` generates and persists three random
secrets to `$OPENHOST_APP_DATA_DIR/secrets/`:

- `JWT_KEY` — signs room-invite JWTs.
- `API_KEY_SECRET` — required by the REST API.
- `SESSION_SECRET` — session cookie signing.

It also generates a random admin password for the `admin` host-role
account and **logs it once** at container start. Grab it with:

```bash
oh app logs mirotalk-p2p | grep -A3 "host-admin credentials"
```

The password is persisted to
`$OPENHOST_APP_DATA_DIR/secrets/HOST_USERS.json`. To rotate it, edit
that file and restart the app.

## Host protection

`HOST_PROTECTED=true` is on by default. That means **anyone** can
enter a room, but to claim the *host* role (the one that can kick,
mute, and enable/disable features for everyone else), a user must log
in at `/login` with the admin credentials above.

If you want to disable host gating and let anyone become host, set
`HOST_PROTECTED=false` in the Dockerfile `ENV` block and redeploy.

If you want to require login to *enter* a room (not just claim host),
set `HOST_USER_AUTH=true`.

## STUN / TURN

WebRTC needs to punch through NAT. The app defaults to:

- **STUN**: `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302` (public Google STUN).
- **TURN**: disabled.

STUN is enough when both peers are on reasonable networks. It is
**not** enough on:

- Mobile carriers (symmetric NAT).
- Restrictive corporate firewalls that block outgoing UDP to non-443
  ports.

On those networks, two-participant calls will show both tiles
connecting but stuck forever. If that happens to your users, run a
TURN server (e.g. self-hosted [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn),
or a commercial provider) and configure it by editing the Dockerfile's
`ENV` block:

```
TURN_SERVER_ENABLED=true
TURN_SERVER_URL=turn:your-turn.example.com:3478
TURN_SERVER_USERNAME=your-username
TURN_SERVER_CREDENTIAL=your-password
```

Do **not** use the `metered.ca` credentials that ship in MiroTalk's
upstream `.env.template` — those are shared demo credentials that
are rate-limited and visible to every MiroTalk deployer on the
internet.

## Storage

Nothing persistent except the three generated secrets +
`HOST_USERS.json` described above. Room state, peer lists, and chat
history are kept in memory and disappear when the container
restarts. Recording is fully client-side (`MediaRecorder`); files
download to the user's machine.

## Resource requirements

Very light. The default `memory_mb = 512`, `cpu_millicores = 500`
handles dozens of concurrent rooms easily because the server only
relays signaling messages. Scale up only if you enable the optional
ChatGPT / OIDC / Slack / Sentry integrations.

## What's intentionally not enabled

Most of the upstream's optional integrations are off by default to
keep the attack surface small and avoid leaking credentials through
log messages:

- **OIDC / Auth0** (`OIDC_ENABLED=false`)
- **ChatGPT** (`CHATGPT_ENABLED=false`)
- **Slack** (`SLACK_ENABLED=false`)
- **Mattermost** (`MATTERMOST_ENABLED=false`)
- **Sentry** (`SENTRY_ENABLED=false`)
- **nodemailer email alerts** (`EMAIL_ALERT=false`)
- **Umami stats** (`STATS_ENABLED=false`)
- **ngrok** (`NGROK_ENABLED=false`)

Turn them on by editing the Dockerfile `ENV` block and supplying the
corresponding secrets.
